# Calculator
"Calculator" is a web-based project that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional calculator. The project's aim is to provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations quickly and easily.

When users access the project, they will see a calculator interface on the screen, which includes all the basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator's layout is designed to be clear and easy to use, with large buttons for each operation and number.

The calculator's functionality is powered by JavaScript, which enables the calculator to perform mathematical operations in real-time. Users can input numbers and operators by clicking on the buttons or by using their keyboard. The calculator's result is displayed in a designated area, which updates automatically with each input.

The project's user interface is designed using HTML and CSS, which provides the calculator's visual appearance and layout. The design is optimized for responsiveness, meaning that the calculator's interface adjusts to different screen sizes, making it accessible to users on a wide range of devices.
